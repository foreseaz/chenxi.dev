Hi!

I'm Chenxi Zhang, a Software Engineer at [Cloudflare Cache Team](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/).
Before that, I've been working in Hong Kong for years and then became a student at [CMU INI](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/).
I'm interested in System-level development and Distributed Systems.
